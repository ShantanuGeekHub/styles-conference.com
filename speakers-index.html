                <p id="head-desc">DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN</p>
            </span>
            <span id="aaron-desc">
                <p>Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge,
                and it doesn’t end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It’s the unwritten
                rules, behavior, beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to get done, or
                it’s what stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to 
                feel valued, we need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed.
                <br><br>
                In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that 
                *get* design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and 
                companies have that others don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your 
                own workplace’s culture. Once you’ve worked within a culture of design it’s almost 
                impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.

                    LIGHTS! CAMERA! INTERACTION! DESIGN INSPIRATION FROM FILMMAKERS</p>
            </span>
            <span id="aaron-desc">
                <p>Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a combination 
                    of well-written narrative and effective storytelling technique. It’s the filmmaker’s 
                    job to put this together. To do so they’ve developed processes, tools and techniques 
                    that allow them to focus attention, emphasize information, foreshadow and produce the 
                    many elements that together comprise a well-told story.
                <br><br>
                With this workshop, we’ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on the 
                technical aspects used in film to communicate. We’ll look at some tools used in film, such 
                as cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We’ll consider why they’re used and how 
                we might look to them for inspiration.

                <h4>ABOUT ADAM</h4>
                Adam Connor is a designer, illustrator and speaker passionate about collaboration, communication,
                creativity and storytelling. As an Experience Design Director with Mad*Pow, Adam combines 10+ years 
                of experience in interaction and experience design with a background in computer science, film, and
                animation to create effective and easy-to-use digital products and services. He believes that no matter 
                how utilitarian a tool is, at the core of its creation lies a story; uncovering that story is key to its 
                success. Occasionally, he shares his perspectives on design at adamconnor.com and discussingdesign.com.</p>

            </span>
            <span id="aaron-desc">
                <p>JavaScript applications frequently utilize battle-tested libraries like jQuery, AngularJS, 
                    Backbone.js and more, but how can we be sure that our code is ready for production? This 
                    talk will share tips on how writing tests can be written easily and quickly and how to 
                    remove buggy code through testing.
